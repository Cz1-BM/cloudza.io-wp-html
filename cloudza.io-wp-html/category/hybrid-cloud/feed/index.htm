				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><b style="font-family: 'Work Sans', Helvetica, Arial, Lucida, sans-serif; font-size: 25px;">Hybrid Cloud &#8211; The best pathway to becoming Cloud-Native</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many companies have the goal of becoming Cloud-Native, but are restricted by complex Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) strategies. These companies could possibly also have issues with change management, due to this complexity of organizational and IT structure. With Hybrid Cloud solutions, organizations can retain their on-premise infrastructure while benefiting from the cloud in certain areas. Hybrid Cloud environments make the move to becoming Cloud-Native easiest and more straightforward, without the need for a monolithic and complicated migration strategy. </span></p>
<h2><b>What is Hybrid Cloud? And why choose Hybrid Cloud?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hybrid Cloud generally refers to an IT infrastructure that is made up of an on-premise environment, as well as a public and/or private cloud environment. Organizations will gain great flexibility and agility, as these interconnected environments will collaborate with each other and ensure that your IT resources are being used to their full potential. </span></p></div>

				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img width="768" height="384" src="https://cloudza-site-webcopy.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/flexare2.png" alt="" title="flexare2" class="wp-image-1696" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>Hybrid Cloud vs Cloud-Native vs On-Premise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above &#8211; making the move to a Cloud-Native environment is the ideal end goal for companies, however doing a once-off migration of all the IT resources to the cloud can be very complex and complicated, with many moving parts. Additionally, these companies could face losing valuable cost savings, as the on-premise infrastructure they planned and paid for will go unutilized. This brings up one of the biggest issues with on-premise environments, they require long financial planning periods, maintenance with manpower and many more costs that are not always accounted for (e.g. electricity, property, security, etc…). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Hybrid cloud approach these companies can still make use of their on-premise systems which they are familiar with, while slowly modernizing their resources and applications. This gives them time to offload their on-premise hardware, and not experience any operational impact. Hybrid Cloud environments allow for increased agility, scalability, cost savings, and ultimately initiates the migration to a cloud-native solution, with a manageable and controlled approach to modernizing IT resources.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is the Hybrid Cloud approach?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hybrid Cloud approach refers to the decoupling and deployment of smaller sets of IT resources into the cloud. An example would be by having the business critical resources and applications continue to run in the on-premise environment, but then having a Disaster Recovery and Backup solution move to a cloud-native environment. </span></p>
<h2><b>Security and Disaster Recovery</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disaster Recovery and off-site Backup solutions are a great way to begin introducing your IT teams to the cloud. By having your cloud environment setup to be your DR and backup environment, it enables you to save costs while still having a redundant backup site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows for your familiar resources to continue running on-premise, and in the case of a failure or loss of data, your cloud DR site will be able to immediately resume operations. This minimizes downtime and allows you to continue running your resources and applications on the cloud, without being affected by your compromised on-premise environment. </span></p></div>
