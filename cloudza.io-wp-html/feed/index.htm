				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><b style="font-family: 'Work Sans', Helvetica, Arial, Lucida, sans-serif; font-size: 25px;">Hybrid Cloud &#8211; The best pathway to becoming Cloud-Native</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many companies have the goal of becoming Cloud-Native, but are restricted by complex Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) strategies. These companies could possibly also have issues with change management, due to this complexity of organizational and IT structure. With Hybrid Cloud solutions, organizations can retain their on-premise infrastructure while benefiting from the cloud in certain areas. Hybrid Cloud environments make the move to becoming Cloud-Native easiest and more straightforward, without the need for a monolithic and complicated migration strategy. </span></p>
<h2><b>What is Hybrid Cloud? And why choose Hybrid Cloud?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hybrid Cloud generally refers to an IT infrastructure that is made up of an on-premise environment, as well as a public and/or private cloud environment. Organizations will gain great flexibility and agility, as these interconnected environments will collaborate with each other and ensure that your IT resources are being used to their full potential. </span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_3">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img width="768" height="384" src="https://cloudza-site-webcopy.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/cloudza.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/flexare2.png" alt="" title="flexare2" class="wp-image-1696" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_8  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>Hybrid Cloud vs Cloud-Native vs On-Premise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above &#8211; making the move to a Cloud-Native environment is the ideal end goal for companies, however doing a once-off migration of all the IT resources to the cloud can be very complex and complicated, with many moving parts. Additionally, these companies could face losing valuable cost savings, as the on-premise infrastructure they planned and paid for will go unutilized. This brings up one of the biggest issues with on-premise environments, they require long financial planning periods, maintenance with manpower and many more costs that are not always accounted for (e.g. electricity, property, security, etc…). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Hybrid cloud approach these companies can still make use of their on-premise systems which they are familiar with, while slowly modernizing their resources and applications. This gives them time to offload their on-premise hardware, and not experience any operational impact. Hybrid Cloud environments allow for increased agility, scalability, cost savings, and ultimately initiates the migration to a cloud-native solution, with a manageable and controlled approach to modernizing IT resources.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is the Hybrid Cloud approach?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hybrid Cloud approach refers to the decoupling and deployment of smaller sets of IT resources into the cloud. An example would be by having the business critical resources and applications continue to run in the on-premise environment, but then having a Disaster Recovery and Backup solution move to a cloud-native environment. </span></p>
<h2><b>Security and Disaster Recovery</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disaster Recovery and off-site Backup solutions are a great way to begin introducing your IT teams to the cloud. By having your cloud environment setup to be your DR and backup environment, it enables you to save costs while still having a redundant backup site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows for your familiar resources to continue running on-premise, and in the case of a failure or loss of data, your cloud DR site will be able to immediately resume operations. This minimizes downtime and allows you to continue running your resources and applications on the cloud, without being affected by your compromised on-premise environment. </span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is one of the best object storage solutions in the industry at the moment. It offers a plethora of different S3 Storage Classes to choose from, and each one serves a different purpose that is generally based on the frequency of access to the data. </span></p>
</blockquote></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_21  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archival and historical data would use different storage classes when compared to a solution that needs data storage for a static website. S3 objects are kept in S3 buckets, and S3 Storage Classes are configured at the object-level, meaning that you can have objects in the same bucket that belong to different S3 Storage Classes. S3 Lifecycle Policies can be used to automatically move objects between different storage classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally there is a retrieval fee for data being accessed, and the cost of this retrieval fee normally becomes more expensive when moving from the frequently accessed storage classes to the archival storage classes. Alternatively, the cost of the storage itself is generally cheaper when using the archival storage classes as opposed to the other classes, however the retrieval fees can be higher.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, AWS launched the new Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval. With this new S3 Storage Class, customers get the best of both worlds when it comes to choosing the most appropriate and compliant storage class while still having millisecond access to data. S3 Glacier was a great storage class for archival and historical data, however the retrieval costs and retrieval time were higher than the other S3 Storage Classes (with the exception of Amazon Glacier Deep Archive). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><b>S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is the newest storage class, this offers the lowest cost for archival storage while still allowing for instantaneous retrieval times. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is now the fastest way to access archival data with S3, giving customers an archival solution with the same high throughput and milliseconds access as the S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a revitalized way of storing archival data, giving customers the ability to store archival data using a lower cost storage class, while still having the ability to access that data within seconds. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval works well with archival data that is accessed more than quarterly, and is ideal for storing data like medical images, genomic sequences, satellite images, news media assets, user-generated content and archival data that requires milliseconds access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><b>S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This S3 Storage class was previously known as Amazon S3 Glacier. It provides a lower cost than storage classes such as S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering and the S3 Infrequent Access classes. The data is only available within minutes to hours, making this storage class the best solution for backups, disaster recovery, offsite data storage, and for when data occasionally needs to be retrieved within minutes. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval works best for data that does not require immediate access, but still needs the flexibility of it’s retrieval options for backups and disaster recovery, with free bulk retrievals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><b>S3 Glacier Deep Archive</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This S3 storage class is ideal for data only accessed once or twice a year, offering long-term retention and data preservation for archival data. S3 Glacier Deep Archive offers the lowest storage costs compared to all the other storage options, however doesn’t allow for millisecond access to the archival data. This S3 storage class is the ideal storage solution for use in highly-regulated industries with strict compliance requirements, such as financial services, healthcare, and public sectors, that need to retain their data for 7—10 years or longer. The retrieval time for S3 Glacier can be up to 12 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><b>S3 Standard</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon S3 Standard can be seen as the general purpose storage classes, it offers high durability and high throughput all with low latency. An important thing to note is that Amazon S3 Standard, your data is available instantaneously, i.e. within milliseconds. This make is the storage class for many different use cases such as, cloud-based applications, static and dynamic websites, big data analytics,  content distribution, mobile applications and gaming applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><b>S3 Intelligent-Tiering</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon S3 also has a storage class for data with unknown usage or changing access patterns, where you may not know exactly how frequently the data will be accessed and therefore aren’t sure which S3 Storage Class to choose. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering  intelligently moves objects between different storage classes based on how frequently the object is being accessed. S3 Intelligent-Tiering will choose the more cost-effective storage class for your data, without impacting performance, accumulating retrieval fees and ultimately reducing operational overhead. This storage class is best used with data with unknown usage patterns, if you know the usage patterns or if they become predictable, you can find more cost savings by choosing another storage class more appropriate for your storage needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2><b>Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These S3 Storage Classes are for data accessed less frequently, but still require the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard. These classes offer a lower per GB storage price and retrieval cost to S3 Standard.  The main differentiator with S3 One Zone-IA is that the data is stored in one Available Zone (AZ), as opposed to the other storage classes that store the data in at least three different AZs to increase durability. Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, offers a lower cost of storage compared to S3 Standard-IA, generally reducing costs by 20%. These S3 storage classes are ideal for copies of on-premise backups and disaster recovery files.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) service that enables you to provision resources using code, meaning you can thoroughly and efficiently configure deployments and environments using code.</span></p>
</blockquote></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_27  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>Infrastructure-as-Code made easy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terraform allows you to edit, update, and version your infrastructure through code. Having your infrastructure deployed through the code, enables you to repeat deployments and solutions using that same code in the future. This allows you not only to have repeatable IPs, but also disposable deployments, which will be covered in more detail in later sections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terraform has been compared to AWS CloudFormation, which is an AWS service that allows you to use code to provision, update and version resources on your AWS cloud infrastructure. Terraform is a AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Technology Partner, and is known for choosing AWS cloud as their preferred cloud infrastructure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terraform is a product of Hashicorp, it is Hashicorp’s IaC tool. Manually defining your resources and infrastructure through code comes with many benefits, that include things like the ability to manage infrastructures across multiple cloud platforms, a configuration language that is easy to read and write in and the ability to track, version and collaborate on your configuration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compatibility and platform affinity are great benefits that come with using Terraform, considering Terraform utilizes Application Programming Interfaces (API) in order to interact and integrate with many different platforms and services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The link below will show the extended list of provider APIs that Terraform supports:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><a href="https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers</span></a></p>

				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img width="2400" height="870" src="https://cloudza-site-webcopy.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/cloudza.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/terraform-iac.png" alt="" title="terraform-iac" class="wp-image-698" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_28  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>Variables</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terraform utilizes variables to make provisioning and defining resources easier, while also making the overall code cleaner and more efficient to use. Terraform variables are written using its own JSON-type syntax known as HCl (Hashicorp language), additionally Terraform still has support for JSON.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terraform makes use of input and output variables, and these can be seen as function arguments and function return values respectively. With variables you are able to reference different modules or pieces of code from areas in your configuration, making it easier to make changes and edits to the configuration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Modules</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modules are used for grouping your code and your Terraform configuration files in a more logical and tidy manner, giving your configuration more structure and allowing you to re-use certain modules in other projects. Terraform is able to use output variables to reference certain modules in your configuration, this removes the complications that come with having endless lines of code. By doing this, your code becomes compartmentalized and structured in a way that makes more complex architectures much simpler to work on and understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terraform will only run files ending in .tf, meaning your modules won’t be affected,  considering they will be kept in their own subdirectories. This means that your code can be broken down into smaller chunks to serve the larger configuration and deployment plan, and through using variables to make changes to the main .tf file you can control which modules are being referenced and used in the deployment. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Commands</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terraform has many commands to make the deployment of your environment more efficient, while greatly reducing any room for error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the main commands for the Terraform CLI would include:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Init</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare your working directory for other commands</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Validate</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Check whether the configuration is valid</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Plan </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Show changes required by the current configuration</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Apply </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Create or update infrastructure</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Destroy </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Destroy previously-created infrastructure</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a more in-depth look at the commands refer to:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><a href="https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using the Terraform CLI you can always use the -help command for assistance, but you can also use the -help command after another command to find out more about that specific command. Example: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">terraform init -help</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Multi-tier Applications</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-tier Architectures are becoming more and more prevalent in the current technological landscape we see ourselves in today. Terraform works very well with multi-tier architectures, as it understands the dependencies and the priorities of different resources in different infrastructures. A simple example of this would be when it is creating resources it will know to create the subnets before creating any web servers, and to link those web servers to the corresponding web nodes. This ability to realize dependencies extends to all the different dependencies of the different platforms supported by Terraform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terraform can also make testing your production environment easier. By sharing the production environment’s configuration code with something like a “development” or “testing environment”, you are able to quickly spin up a testing environment that is up to date with the production environment. Then once any testing is completed you can simply destroy that testing environment, this makes these configurations reusable and disposable at the same time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Collaboration</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using Terraform Cloud, which is free for up to five users, you can share your state with other users in your team. With Terraform’s remote state backends, it allows you to collaborate with your teammates in a stable environment that enables multiple users to work on the same configurations. Additionally you can connect Terraform with different version control systems (VCSs), such as GitHub, giving you version control that helps prevent any overwrites or deletes to the configuration.  </span></p></div>
